        Chapter 8: Forms

        Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code.

        Forms can also be submitted by pressing enter.

        legacy DOM has a useful property called "document.forms" that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document.
        You need to use the index notation to return the form objects.
        This is the equivalent of using "const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];"
        Instead of using the numerical index, we can use the name attribute to identify a form.
        const form = document.forms['search'];

        You can also call the elements method that returns an HTML collection of all elements contained in the form.
        const [input,button] = form.elements;

        Specific elements can be accessed using notation like this:
        const input = form.searchInput
        const input = form['searchInput']

        form.submit() can be used to submit the form automatically.

        You can use any of these to submit the form, as well:
        button type='submit'>Submit  /button>
        input type='submit' value='Submit'>
        input type='image' src='button.png'>"

        form.reset() will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.
        or a button with a type attribute of reset.

        form.action can be used to set the action attribute of a form so it's sent to a different URL to be processed.
        form.action = '/an/other.url'
