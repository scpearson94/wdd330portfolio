        Object Methods: this

        Prefer shorter syntax to declare a method 

        // these objects do the same 
        user = { 
            sayHi: function() { 
                alert("Hello"); 
            } 
        }; 

        // method shorthand looks better, right? \
        user = { 
            sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function()" 
                alert("Hello"); 
            } 
        };

        The value of "this" is the object "before dot", the one used to call the method.

        In other words, "this" refers to the current object.

        Using this as opposed to the actual object reference avoids code errors.

        ***In Js, "this" behaves differently than most other programming languages. It can be used in any function.

        If you call a function without using an object, "this" within the function is undefined. (If you are in strict
        In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, 
        but rather on what object is “before the dot”.

        Arrow functions don't have their own "this."
        Arrow functions refer to the outer function when using this.

        You can return a literal object when using the return statment within a function.

        Site for array functions: https://gist.github.com/ljharb/58faf1cfcb4e6808f74aae4ef7944cff

        array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
        the function is required, the value w/in the function is required, index is not required, arr is not required, and thisValue is not required.

        Events

        Every time that a user interacts with a web page, an event occurs.

        Event Listeners

        Rather than an approach called blocking where you would have to "check your email every couple of seconds," JS uses a non-blocking approach.
        This is to use event listeners.

        document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);

        Inline event handlers

        The original way of dealing with events...
        <p onclick="console.log('You Clicked Me!')">Click ➥ Me</p>

        This isn't recommended. 

        Another Older Event Handler

        document.onclick = function (){ console.log('You clicked on ➥ the page!'); }

        This method is an improvement ont he inline handleras it keeps JS out of the markup, but it still has restrictions.
        Only one function can be used for each event.


        If you add an event listener without a node reference, it references the whole page.
        addEventListener('click', () => alert('You Clicked!'));

        **parentheses are not placed after the function when it's used as the argument to an event listener. Otherwise, the function will actually be called when the event listener is set.

        When an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function automatically is passed an event object as a parameter.

        function doSomething(event){
            console.log(event.type);
        }
        << click

        **the parameter does not have to be called event.

        The Event Target

        the target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event.
        function doSomething(event){
            console.log(event.target);
        }
        << p id='click'>Click On Me/p>

        Coordinates of an Event
        
        function doSomething(event){
            console.log(`screen: (${event.screenX},${event.screenY}),
            ➥ page: (${event.pageX},${event.pageY}), client:
            ➥ (${event.screenX},${event.screenY})`)
        }

        addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'c' && event.ctrlKey) {
            console.log('Action canceled!');
            }
        });

        Touch Events
        
        addEventListener('touchend', () => console.log('Touch ➥ stopped');


        Event listeners can be removed...

        p id='once'>A One Time Thing.../p>

        const onceParagraph = document.getElementById('once');
        onceParagraph.addEventListener('click', remove);

        function remove(event) {
        console.log('Enjoy this while it lasts!');
        onceParagraph.style.backgroundColor = 'pink';
        onceParagraph.removeEventListener('click',remove);
        }

        Events are said to propogate as they move from one element to another (down the DOM)

        Bubbling is when the event fires on each element.
