        Object Methods: this

        Prefer shorter syntax to declare a method 

        // these objects do the same 
        user = { 
            sayHi: function() { 
                alert("Hello"); 
            } 
        }; 

        // method shorthand looks better, right? \
        user = { 
            sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function()" 
                alert("Hello"); 
            } 
        };

        The value of "this" is the object "before dot", the one used to call the method.

        In other words, "this" refers to the current object.

        Using this as opposed to the actual object reference avoids code errors.

        ***In Js, "this" behaves differently than most other programming languages. It can be used in any function.

        If you call a function without using an object, "this" within the function is undefined. (If you are in strict
        In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, 
        but rather on what object is “before the dot”.

        Arrow functions don't have their own "this."
        Arrow functions refer to the outer function when using this.

        You can return a literal object when using the return statment within a function.

        array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
        the function is required, the value w/in the function is required, index is not required, arr is not required, and thisValue is not required.
