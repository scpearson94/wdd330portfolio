        Chapter 2
        Pay attention to: Variables, Scope, converting/parsing, and template literals

        imagine bindings as tentacles rather than boxes

        a binding name must not start with a digit
        can include $ or _ but no other punctuation or special characters
        don't forget not to use keywords as variable names:
        "break case catch class const continue debugger default
        delete do else enum export extends false finally for
        function if implements import interface in instanceof let
        new package private protected public return static super
        switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield"

        you can use commas in the console.log function to include multiple literals or Variables

        loops!!
        In general, it is a good idea to start counting from 0.

        I love for loops

        Use "break" to get out of a loop

        Using % is an easy wat to test whether a number is divisible by another number

        the "continue" keyword causes the control to jump out of the body of a loop and continue with the next iteration

        Chapter 3
        Pay special attention: array methods

        use the power function to use exponents

        Scopes!
        global
        local
        multi-level scopes within blocks or functions

        functions as values (requires a semi colon after definition)
        let functionName = function() {}
        this means you can pass functions as values

        you don't necessarily have to define a function above where you used it in your code. You can define it below.

        Arrow functions (uses the => instead of the function keyword)
        such as    const power = (base, exponent) => {};

        Parameters of functions!
        When calling a funtion with only one param but you call it with three, the function executes just fine and uses the first param sent.
        You can also send less than the defined params. The other params will remain undefined in the function execution.

        A function body can also access the whole list of arguments passed.
        (like the console.log function)

        You can access the saved value of a local binding from a function despite having left the function.
        Local values created within functions are created anew with each call.

        Recursion
        a function can call itself
        just don't overflow the stack

        
        Chapter 4
        Pay attention: concept of callbacks

        it is better practice to use const or let in front of variable declarations instead of var.
        
        callbacks
        functions behave as objects
        a function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
        If the function isn't actually provided as an argument, the code won't work.
        It is possible to check if an argument is a function:
            if (typeof(callback) === 'function') {
                callback();
            }

        You need to use a callback in sorting arrays of numbers to tell it how the numbers should be compared:
            [1,3,12,5,23,18,7].sort(); //wrong!!

            function numerically(a,b) {
                return a-b;
            }



        Iterators through arrays

        can use a forEach() function to cycle through each item in an array:
        myArray.forEach((myArrayItem, index) =>
            console.log("array item at position ${index} is ${myArrayItem}"));

        or you can use the map() method. it iterates over an array and takes a callback function as a param.
        the callback function is invoked on each item in the array.
            [1,2,3].map(square);
                or
            [1,2,3].map( x => 2 * x );

        reduce() method iterates an array, but combines each result to return just one value.
            [1,2,3,4,5].reduce((acc,val) => prev + val);

        filter(). it provides a useful way to find all the truthy values from an array.

        chaining iterators together
