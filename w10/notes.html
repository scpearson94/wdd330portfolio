    Client-Side Form Validation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation

    This is called form validation. 
    When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct 
    format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side 
    validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapters we are 
    focusing on client-side validation.

    client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure.
    Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the 
    client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad 
    data through to your server.

    Reasons for validation web forms:
    -We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data 
    is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
    -We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their 
    account information.
    -We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage 
    the application (see Website security).

    Types of client side validation:
    -built-in form validation using HTML
    -JavaScript validation

    Built-in Validation

    required, minlength, maxlength, min, max, type, pattern

    When an element is valid, it matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class
    When an element is invalid, it matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class (and sometimes others like :out-of-range)

    JavaScript Validation

    JavaScript will allow you to take control over the look and feel of the native error messages or to deal with 
    legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation.
