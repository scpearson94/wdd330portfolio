    Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions

    Forms

    It's possible to process form data on the front end when a form is submitted.

    WAI-ARIA labels

    you shoul create the form and a main.js file to put the JS in. 
    This can be saved in the same directory as the file with the form in it.

    Accessing Form Elements

    document.forms
    returns a collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.
    Even if there is only one form, you still need to use index notation to access the form object.

    You could also use the name attribute to identify a form:
    name="search"
    const form = document.forms.search;
    const form = document.forms['search'];

    A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. 
    const [input,button] = form.elements;
    const input = form.searchInput
    const input = form['searchInput']

    Form Properties and Methods

    use form.submit() to submit the form automatically.
    a form can be submitted using any of these elements:
    button type='submit'>Submit/button> 
    input type='submit' value='Submit'> 
    input type='image' src='button.png'>

    form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values in the HTML
    or a button with the type attribute of reset (these are considered poor for usability)
    
    form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form.

    focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an input element, this is when the cursor is places inside the element.
    const input = form.elements.searchInput;
    input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false)

    blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.

    change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it.
    the blur event fires after the change event

    Submitting a Form

    the most important event is the submit event occuring when the form is submitted.
    Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JS to intercept the form before it's sent by assing a submit event listener:
    const form = document.forms['search']; 
    form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);
    function search() { alert(' Form Submitted'); }

    With the submit listener, the event is triggered first and then the form tries to submit.

    To stop the form from being submitted to the URL altogether, use the preventDefault() method.
    function search(event) { 
        alert('Form Submitted'); 
        event.preventDefault(); 
    }

    Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form

    Use the value property of the element object to retrieve the text inside the field:
    function search(event) { 
        alert(`You Searched for: ${input.value}`); 
        event.preventDefault(); 
    }

    It's also possible to set the value using JS.

    To remove (or add) the default text in an input element when the user clicks inside it:
    input.addEventListener('focus', function(){ 
        if (input.value==='Search Here') { 
            input.value = '' 
        } 
    }, false);
    input.addEventListener('blur', function(){ 
        if(input.value === '') { 
            input.value = 'Search Here'; 
        } 
    }, false);

    Similarly, you can use the placeholder attribute in the HTML markup.
    This has a slightly different effect, though. The placeholder is not actually a value of the input field, so it won't be submitted as the field's value.

    Input Fields

    text is the default type of an input field.

    Password input fields is used to emter passwords or secret information.
    The characters are concealed as they are entered.

    Checkboxes

    the name attribute should be the same for all related checkbox elements.
    In JS, you have to loop through the collection of checkboxes to see which are checked and which are not.
    
    hero.powers = [...form.powers].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value);
    this uses the spread operator to turn the node list into an array to allow us to use the filter method

    a checkbox can be set to true using JS.
    document.forms.hero.powers[0].checked = true;

    Radio Buttons
