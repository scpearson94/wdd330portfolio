    Chapter 9: The Window Object

    Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually propertied of the global window object
    and any functions are methods of it.
    It represents the browser window that contains a web page.

    The Browser Object Model
    BOM for short is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
    For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though this is unreliable),
    the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, which pages have been visited before the current page, 
    and creating pop-up windows (though that annoys your user).

    There are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all major browsers.
    These properties and methods are made available through the window object.
    Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.

    BOM only makes sense in a browser environment.
    (Node.js has an object called global instead)
    If you don't know the name of the global object, you can refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope:
    // from within the global scope
    const global = this;

    Going Global

    global variables are variables that are created without using the const, let, or var keywords.

    In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object.
    An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined (the following will throw a refeneceerror if x has not been defined):
    if (x) {
        // do something
    }

    However, if the variable is accessed as a property of the window object, then the code will still work, as window.x will simply return false:
    if (window.x) {
        // do something
    }
    
    Some functions are built in global methods (e.g. parseInt() and isNaN()).
    In ES6, these two were made methods of the Number object.

    Dialogs

    alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are all dialogs.

    alert() will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
    The message is rovided as an argument to the method. Undefined is always returned.

    confirm() will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument and gives the options OK or Cancel.
    It returns true if the user clicks OK and false if the user clicks Cancel.

    prompt() method will stop the execution of the program, display a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument and an input field that allows the user to enter.
    This text is returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.

    This can be used as a final check to see if a user wants to delete a resource. 
    Most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing, meaning they are not a feature to be relied upon.

    Browser Information

    the navigator object contains information about the browser being used. 
    Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system beign used:
    window.navigator.userAgent
    << "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3) AppleWebKit/602.4.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.3 Safari/602.4.8"

    Don't rely on this, though, as it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser.

    Window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide info about the different fragments of the URL.
    The href property returns the full URL as a string:
    window.location.href
    << "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"

    This property (as well as most others described) is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment.

    protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.).
    There is a colon (:) at the end of the string.

    host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (often omitted if the default port 80 is used):
    window.location.host
    << "www.sitepoint.com"

    hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:
    window.location.hostname
    << "www.sitepoint.com"

    port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL:
    window.location.port
    << ""

    pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:
    window.location.pathname
    << "/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"

    search property returns a string that starts with a ? followed by the query string parameters. It returns empty if there are no query params:
    window.location.search
    << "?q=javascript&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&amp;order="

    hash property returns a string that starets with a # followed by the fragment identifier. IT returns empty if there is no fragment identifier:
    window.location.hash
    << ""

    origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only.
    window.location.origin
    << "https://www.sitepoint.com"

    window.location methods:
    reload() can be used to force reload of a current page.
    assign() can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a param: window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/')
    replace() is almost the same as assign() except the current page will not be stored in the session history (so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button)
    toString() returns a string containing the whole URL

    The Browser History

    window.history property can be used to access info about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.

    window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.

    window.history.go() can be used to go to a specific page (where 0 is the current page):
    window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page
    window.history.go(0); // reloads the current page
    window.history.go(-1); // goes back 1 page

    there are also window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate forward and backwards by one page respectively.

    Controlling Windows

    window.open() opens a new window and takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first param, the window title as its second param, and a list of attributre as the third param. 
    This can also be assigned to a variable so the window can then be referenced later in the code:
    const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');

    close() closes a window assuming you have a reference to it:
    popup.close();

    window.moveTo() moves a window and takes two params that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved to.
    window.moveTo(0,0); // will move the window to the top-left corner of the screen

    resize() resizes a window and takes two params that specify the width and height of the resized window:
    window.resizeTo(600,400);

    These methods are seen as annoying... and give JS a bad name. Many of them can be blocked by a browser given certain conditions.

    Screen Information

    window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.
    You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties.

    availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen (excluding any operating system menus).

    colorDepth can be used to find the color bit depth of the users monitor (though there are few cases for doing this other than statistics).

    the screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It allows you to do things like turn off the device's screen, detect a change in its orientation or lock it in a specific orientation.

    media queries and feature detection are often better practices.

    The Document Object

    properties and methods that deal with the hpage that has been loaded into the window.

    Chapter 6 covers DOM.

    document.write() simply writes a string of text to the page. If the page has already loaded, it will completely replace the current document.
    It is possible to include HTML in the string passed to write().
    It can be used inside script tags to inject a string into the markup. This will not overwrite the rest of the HTML.
    The use of write() is heavily frowned upon. There are some extremely rare legitimate uses of it.

    Cookies

    These can be used to store information that can then be retrieved between requests.
    
    They can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them.
    This is to stop sites being able to access information about users.

    They are also limited to storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain which can add up.

    Cookies can be used for personalizing a user's browsing experience, storign user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as shopping cart), authentication, and tracking users.
    The use of cookies for trackingn has been much maligned in recent years.
    The use for data storage is starting to be replaced in many cases by the new HTML5 localStorage API as it allows more data to be stored (Chapter 14).

    They are still used for retaining state information (like if a user is logged in) because they're passed between client and server on every HTTP request.

    Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons:
    "name=Superman; hero=true; city=Metropolis"

    It may be a good idea to ask for permission to set cookies.

    Creating Cookies

    document.cookie = 'name=Superman';
    << "name=Superman"

    the document.cookie property acts like a special type of string.
    Assigning another cookies won't overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string.

    Changing cookie values

    a cookie's value can be changed by using the same name but a different value:
    document.cookie = 'name=Batman'
    << "name=Batman"
    document.cookie = 'city=Gotham'
    << "city=Gotham"

    Reading Cookies

    to see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie:
    document.cookie:
    << "name=Batman; hero=true; city=Gotham"

    We can use the split method to break the string into an array containing each name/value pair, then use a for loop to iterate through the array.
    const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
    for (crumb of cookies){
    const [key,value] = crumb.split("=");
    console.log(`The value of ${key} is ${value}`);
    }
    << The value of name is Batman
    The value of hero is true
    The value of city is Gotham

    To see an example of cookies used int he wild, you can visit almost an website, open the browser console, and type document.cookie.

    Cookie Expiry Dates

    Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished.
    They can be made persistent by adding "; espires=date" to the end of the cookie when it's set, where the date is a date value in the UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT. This expires in one day:
    const expiryDate = new Date();
    const tomorrow = expiryDate.getTime() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
    expiryDate.setTime(tomorrow);
    document.cookie = `name=Batman; expires=${expiryDate.toUTCString()}`;

    an alternative is to set the max-age value:
    document.cookie = 'name=Batman; max-age=86400' // 86400 secs = 1 day

    Don't rely on cookie expiry for apps that contain sensitive information. Browsers can sometimes hold on to the information stored in a cookie that should have expired when the 'session restore' feature is used after a crash.

    The Path and Domain of Cookies

    By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set.
    The path can be changed so that any page in the root directory can read the cookie:
    document.cookie = 'name=Batman; path=/';

    It's also possible to set the domain:
    document.cookie = 'name=Batman; domain=sitepoint.com';
    
    Doing this will allow subdomains to read the cookie.

    Secure Cookies
