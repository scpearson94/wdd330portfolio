    Chapter 9: The Window Object

    Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually propertied of the global window object
    and any functions are methods of it.
    It represents the browser window that contains a web page.

    The Browser Object Model
    BOM for short is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
    For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though this is unreliable),
    the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, which pages have been visited before the current page, 
    and creating pop-up windows (though that annoys your user).

    There are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all major browsers.
    These properties and methods are made available through the window object.
    Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.

    BOM only makes sense in a browser environment.
    (Node.js has an object called global instead)
    If you don't know the name of the global object, you can refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope:
    // from within the global scope
    const global = this;

    Going Global

    global variables are variables that are created without using the const, let, or var keywords.

    In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object.
    An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined (the following will throw a refeneceerror if x has not been defined):
    if (x) {
        // do something
    }

    However, if the variable is accessed as a property of the window object, then the code will still work, as window.x will simply return false:
    if (window.x) {
        // do something
    }
    
    Some functions are built in global methods (e.g. parseInt() and isNaN()).
    In ES6, these two were made methods of the Number object.
