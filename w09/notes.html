    Chapter 9: The Window Object

    Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually propertied of the global window object
    and any functions are methods of it.
    It represents the browser window that contains a web page.

    The Browser Object Model
    BOM for short is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
    For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though this is unreliable),
    the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, which pages have been visited before the current page, 
    and creating pop-up windows (though that annoys your user).

    There are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all major browsers.
    These properties and methods are made available through the window object.
    Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.

    BOM only makes sense in a browser environment.
    (Node.js has an object called global instead)
    If you don't know the name of the global object, you can refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope:
    // from within the global scope
    const global = this;

    Going Global

    global variables are variables that are created without using the const, let, or var keywords.

    In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object.
    An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined (the following will throw a refeneceerror if x has not been defined):
    if (x) {
        // do something
    }

    However, if the variable is accessed as a property of the window object, then the code will still work, as window.x will simply return false:
    if (window.x) {
        // do something
    }
    
    Some functions are built in global methods (e.g. parseInt() and isNaN()).
    In ES6, these two were made methods of the Number object.

    Dialogs

    alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are all dialogs.

    alert() will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
    The message is rovided as an argument to the method. Undefined is always returned.

    confirm() will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument and gives the options OK or Cancel.
    It returns true if the user clicks OK and false if the user clicks Cancel.

    prompt() method will stop the execution of the program, display a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument and an input field that allows the user to enter.
    This text is returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.

    This can be used as a final check to see if a user wants to delete a resource. 
    Most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing, meaning they are not a feature to be relied upon.

    Browser Information

    the navigator object contains information about the browser being used. 
    Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system beign used:
    window.navigator.userAgent
    << "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3) AppleWebKit/602.4.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.3 Safari/602.4.8"

    Don't rely on this, though, as it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser.

    Window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide info about the different fragments of the URL.
    The href property returns the full URL as a string:
    window.location.href
    << "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"

    This property (as well as most others described) is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment.

    protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.).
    There is a colon (:) at the end of the string.

    host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (often omitted if the default port 80 is used):
    window.location.host
    << "www.sitepoint.com"

    hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:
    window.location.hostname
    << "www.sitepoint.com"

    port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL:
    window.location.port
    << ""

    pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:
    window.location.pathname
    << "/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"

    search property returns a string that starts with a ? followed by the query string parameters. It returns empty if there are no query params:
    window.location.search
    << "?q=javascript&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&amp;order="

    hash property returns a string that starets with a # followed by the fragment identifier. IT returns empty if there is no fragment identifier:
    window.location.hash
    << ""

    origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only.
    window.location.origin
    << "https://www.sitepoint.com"

    window.location methods:
    reload() can be used to force reload of a current page.
    assign() can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a param: window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/')
    replace() is almost the same as assign() except the current page will not be stored in the session history (so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button)
    toString() returns a string containing the whole URL

    The Browser History

    window.history property can be used to access info about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.

    window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.

    window.history.go() can be used to go to a specific page (where 0 is the current page):
    window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page
    window.history.go(0); // reloads the current page
    window.history.go(-1); // goes back 1 page

    there are also window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate forward and backwards by one page respectively.
